As part of the Systems Security course, myself and another student (AÃ°alsteinn) performed a security investigation on a mobile application called 'Flytoget'. 
The application allows users to purchase and view train tickets to and from Oslo airport. By leveraging techniques we learned throughout the course, we were able
ascertain weak security implementations of the applcation, resulting in a number of vulnerabilities being uncovered, including account takeover. 
The process was very revealing as to the realities of security in widely used applications that handle sensitive data. Let's take a quick look at one of the
vulnerabilities discovered and explain how good secuirty pracitce could have prevented it. 

The authentication mechanism:
- Still in the process of disclosure, so will wait to writeup until finished.

Through the help of our professor, Diego, we contacted the company to disclose the vulnerabilities. They were grateful for the report, and have said that 
the vulnerabilities have been fixed. We have not performed a review of claimed fixes. The company have not put out a disclosure statement regarding potential
leaking of confidential user data. We only exploited our own accounts for obvious reasons.
