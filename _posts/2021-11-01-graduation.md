After 4 years and a lot of learning, I have graduated with a degree in Computer Science. I had fantastic peers, lecturers, and supervisors which made my education richer than I could have asked for. COVID was certainly a challenge, and I was quite grateful to hand in my final assessment. I am not sure where next year will lead, however I aim to embrace any and all oportunities which come my way. Thanks for 4 great years QUT!
