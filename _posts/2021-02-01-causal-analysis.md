At the end of 2020 / beginning of 2021, I worked on a research project under the supervision of Dr. Zahra Jadidi. The project was an investigation into causal analysis of event logs within industrial control systems. The project aimed to help identify and predict the actions of APTs within ICSs. The project ran over the course of a few months and during that time I progressed siginificantly with my research and writing skills. I also developed a deeper understanding of causal machine learning models as well as how to analyse results of noisy data. I presented my results and conclusions in an online 'conference' with other students who undertook projects in different fields.
