The best part of working at Leidos Australia was being able to work with Luke (who has a PhD. in cryptography). I would jump at every opportunity to 'work' with him, just so I could ask an endless stream of questions about his time as a researcher. Every story of his convinced me that I had more I wanted to achieve academically, especially when it came to cryptography. 

In early January 2023 I finally received my Danish citizenship (through my father). About a week later, I had applied to study at Aarhus University for their cryptography program. My acceptance letter came in April. In July, I said a tearful goodbye to all my friends in Australia. My first semester begins August 28th!
